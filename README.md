# Automata-Conversion-and-Simplification

## Overview
This project focuses on converting Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) to Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and simplifying context-free grammars. It enables users to perform basic operations on regular languages.

## Features
- Convert NFA to DFA
- Simplify context-free grammars
- Perform basic regular operations
- User-friendly interface
